[16:47:06] metadept: you are no longer welcome to give feedback in this channel
[16:47:16] metadept: i try to be nice and humor you
[16:47:20] metadept: all you ever do is complain

From my side, I no longer want to do any direct approach with this game's so-called developers and will publish any "complains and findings" in public. They don't want to hear about the real problems and prefer to live in their perfect world? Then let's break their perfect world apart.

Well done, Chucklefish. No wonder people literally call you the worst Early Access project ever.

On another side, I’d really like to question metadept’s professionalism and sanity. Ever since he came to Chucklefish’s team, Starbound began getting worse and worse:

* First, he removed repairable drills and pickaxes, then he deleted the code corresponding to Hunger and Temperature systems, basically cutting off the simulation and survival aspects of the game.
* Then he “rewrote” the world search and starmap generation functions - this rewrite introduced horrendous slowdowns, and now instead of 2-5 seconds the starmap generation takes 1-2 minutes, while the world lookup function now takes 15 minutes(!!).
* Next, he removed “wall hacks”, so you no longer could access the objects thru thin layer of wall bricks - this technique was widely used in building creation.
* And of course, he added utterly annoying non-skipable 3 second teleport animation, original version of which contained epileptic effect, and refused to remove or replace it with something less intrusive.

To anyone whom it may concern: feel free to clone this repository and contribute to this project, if you feel like it.
