# CLeF - Things To Do In Starbound
Starbound content restoration and gameplay overhaul project

Version 49 (2015/08/09)
----------

Known to work with:
- [Stable] Spirited Giraffe Update 5 (May 8)
- [Nightly] Pleased Giraffe Update 0 (August 8)


Installation
------------

Warning! If you have previous version installed, please delete any directories or .modpak files which match "cl*f*" pattern.

Copy the following directories into "starbound/giraffe_storage/mods/" directory:

Required (either Common + SG Stable or Common + PG Nightly. Any other combinations will result in a broken game):

+ CLeF - Common. Core mod files common for all game versions

+ CLeF - SG Stable. For Stable Spirited Giraffe Update 5 (May 8)

+ CLeF - PG Nightly. For Nightly Pleased Giraffe Update 0 (August 8)

Optional (consult "Gameplay changes" section for details):

+ CLeF - Extra. Core mod files incompatible/overlapping functionality with third-parties

+ CLeF - SG Stable - Sandbox. Restores more sandbox gameplay, yet also removes certain restrictions (some people might find it "cheaty". Strongly recommended for people who likes Koala builds over Giraffe). For SG Stable.

+ CLeF - PG Nightly - Sandbox. Same as above, but for PG Nightly.


Overview
--------

As you probably know, not all players are happy with the changes that were made to the game in comparison with Koala builds. Although many new things were added, a lot of the aspects were nerfed or removed altogether, which turned the game into dumb lifeless punishing neverending grind.

This mod is my attempt to address and revert these changes in Giraffe builds to certain degree, as well as introduce other balance tweaks, enhancements and a good portion of entirely new content. ;) It also addresses the poor game's performance on relatively slow hardware and improves it.

Starting from Version 6, CLeF also incorporates work by other awesome people. See the full list of mods and their authors at the end of the description.

Starting from Version 33, CLeF requires you to wipe your universe and shipworld files, otherwise you'll be met with invisible objects and possible crashes.


Frequently Asked Questions
--------------------------

Q: Will you add back Temperature and Hunger mechanics?

A: There are two separate mods which do this:

* http://community.playstarbound.com/resources/2953/ - Hunger & Thirst (by Image_Not_Available)

* http://community.playstarbound.com/resources/2475/ - Temperature Returns (by xxswatelitexx)

Sadly, I can't permanently add them to CLeF, because, once installed, they cannot be uninstalled without the entire savegame wipe. Also, the temperature mod have no means of displaying the required data, since the game's UI lacks of custom HUD indication support.


Q: So, I've repaired my ship and decided to move to another planet in the local system. I'm clicking "GO" and nothing happens.

A: You'll have to fuel your ship first (lava, coal, core fragment ore or even oil will do the trick). Please keep in mind the intraspace travel is no longer free. The fuel cost simply doesn't show up on Tier 2 ships (without repaired FTL drive) due to a bug.


Q: I can't access fuel hatch! My character has stuck at his starter planet! I was playing as custom race.

A: It's impossible for me to fix custom races due to random mod load order and the fact .png definition files cannot be incrementally patched. Please ask the author of that race to move working fuel hatch from Tier 3 ship to Tier 2 (I've asked some of them, and you can find their races in "Recommended mods" section).

Also, you can fix it on your own - open <racename>t2blocks.png and copy fuel hatch pixel (orange-red at the top of a blue block) from <racename>t3blocks.png. Note you'll have to delete your shipworld, otherwise the fix won't be applied (don't forget to take everything you don't want to lose with you).


Q: Wait, you tell people to alter progression just for your mod's compatibility? Who the hell do you think you are?!

A: First, don't be a hysterical brat. It's a single pixel change, which does not affect progression in any way. Even if player will have working fuel hatch, he won't be able to travel past the local solar system, because FTL drive is not working at Tier 2 ship regardless if fuel hatch is available or not.

Besides, Chucklefish might change their mind regarding the fuel and you'll be forced to make that single pixel change anyway.


Q: Okay, I beat the UFO boss. Where's the rest of the quests?

A: The rest of the quests are integrated into Outpost NPC's questlines:

* [Added in v22] Bone Dragon boss is integrated into Outpost Mute Glitch's quest line.

* [Added in v42] Jelly boss is integrated into Outpost Apex Scientist's quest line.

* [Added in v48] Fatal Circuit robot boss is integrated into Outpost Glitch Mercenary's and Penguin Promoter's quest lines.

This mod is work-in-progress. Please be patient.


Q: Will I be able to play on vanilla servers if I'll install this mod?

A: Short answer: no. Long answer: any mod which makes changes to .config files or adds new objects will not be compatible with vanilla servers.


Q: What's with the name? Are you telling us to choke the developers?

A: It's both pun and an allegory. The fish is already dead.


Help wanted
-----------

I have little to no knowledge in Lua, so this prevents me from re-implementing lots of things. I would really appreciate your help.

Also, if you've noticed another feature, object or armor that was removed by Chucklefish and want it back, please tell me immediately!


Known bugs
----------

+ The game prevents patching of items/defaultparameters.config, hence a complete replacement file is used instead. CLeF will conflict with any mods that replace it.

+ CLeF will conflict with any mod which adds "learnBlueprintsOnPickup" variable to items/objects. The solution is to move the above-mentioned variable from CLeF and insert contents of variable into problematic mod's patch.

+ [N] Core fragment ore can be crafted in Alloy Furnace from 10 Lava and 1 Oil (recipe learned on picking the Lava)

+ [N] Erchius Crystal gives 10 points of fuel (same as above)

+ [N] Oil gives 1 point of fuel (it's flammable IRL, so why not?)

+ [N] Lava gives 1 point of fuel (because it's basically the source of core fragments)

+ [R] Coal gives 2 points of fuel (same as in EK, 0 in UG)

+ [N] Teleporter Core can be crafted from 2 Iron Bars and 3 Diamonds

+ [M] All vanilla teleporters from "2-Stop Teleshop" can be crafted via Iron Crafting Table. Each requires 1 Teleporter Core and 1 Circuit board to craft (also, all of them can be safely placed and removed without object's destruction.

 - Brass      : 2 Diamonds, 10 Liquid Oil, 5 Copper Bars and 4 Glass Blocks

+ [N] Added Portable Teleporter object. Can be crafted via Iron Crafting Table for 1 Orange Teleporter Core, 1 Circuit Board, 2 Durasteel Bars and 2 Glass Blocks

+ [M] Replaced teleport effect sprites with blue versions based on original Rho's design

+ [R] The player will start from forest planet (same as in EK, was "Garden" in UG). This largely increases variety in comparison with bland "Lush / Garden" worlds

+ [F] The starter planet lookup values are 5/100 (same as in EK, was 100/300 in UG). Also removed requirement for "Ancient Gateway" dungeon world, since it's always generated in every planetary system. Also removed requirement for "small" world type. This makes the first run universe generation to only take 2 minutes instead of 15(!!) on my machine

+ [M] Intraspace travel takes 5 points of fuel (was 50 in EK, 0 in UG made little to no sense, but...)

+ [F] Fixed inability to fuel your ship for vanilla races when starting a new game (required because intraspace travels are not free anymore)

+ [M] Interspace travel takes 300 points maximum (was 200 in EK and up to 1000 in UG, which is unreal and would leave you with depleted engine. This seems to be the reason (beside the coal not being a "fuel" anymore) why intraspace travel was made cost free in UG, otherwise you'd stuck forever if landed on anything but the Moon or Outpost planet)

+ [N] Limit for items per cell changed to 9999 (was 1000 in EK/UG. Everybody wants to be super greedy sometimes :3 )

+ [N] Removed 1000 items limit for Rope

+ [M] Un-nerfed Morph Ball tech. It consumes 20 points of energy (was 35 in EK and 65 in UG)

+ [R] Iron Beacon is available for crafting. As a result, the Penguin UFO boss can be summoned in open space (moved to its own quest location in UG)

+ [R] Quest "CLeF Tutorial #9.1.1: The First Contact". Automatically assigned upon crafting or picking up the Old Distress Beacon. Reward: 11-900 pixels

+ [M] Dreadwing Codex matches the old-new progression. Also, the boss will drop 5 Molten Core, 21 Core Fragment Ore and 1 Dreadwing Codex

+ [N] Quest "Wreckage of the Dreadwing". Automatically assigned upon picking up the Dreadwing's Wreckage

+ [M] Upon completing the "Dreadwing" quest, penguin will give 50 Matter Item, which can be used to craft Bonus Armour (otherwise the material for it is nowhere to be found)

+ [R] Decoy Princess is available for crafting. As a result, the Bone Dragon boss can be summoned (disabled in UG. Sadly, dragon acts like a bird and won't breathe any fire nor open its mouth. I'm unable to restore its original behaviour without scripting help!)

+ [N] Added decorative Decoy Princess Scheme object. Given by "Mute" Glitch upon starting "Bad To The Bone" quest

+ [N] Quest "Bad To The Bone". Given by "Mute" Glitch at Outpost for players with Tier 5 ship

+ [R] Brain extractor and all robot parts are available for crafting. As a result, you can summon Fatal Circuit, the old robot boss (was removed in UG and replaced by Penguin Bot)

+ [N] Fatal Circuit drops quest item - shorted out Broken Fatal Claw dagger with weak stats

+ [N] Cooking recipe "Brain Stew". Cooked from Wheat, Pearlpea, Corn and Inferior Brain

+ [N] Cooking recipe "Brain Pie. Cooked from Mashed Potato, Inferior Brain and Superior Brain

+ [N] Decorative "Monster's Brain in a Jar" item can be crafted from 1 Inferior Brain, 1 Glass Block and 1 Iron Bar at Crafting Table (recipe learned upon picking up Inferior Brain)

+ [N] Power Loom, a modern replacement for Spinning Wheel, can be crafted in Metalwork Station for 8 Steel Bars

+ [R] Re-added developer clothing sets (can be crafted via Yarn Spinner):
 - Ban's set
 - Bartwe's glasses
 - George's set
 - Kyren's set
 - Molly's set
 - Rhopunzel's set
 - Tiy's set

+ [R] Re-added armour sets:

+ [M] Ice furniture recipes auto-learned on Ice Block pickup

+ [M] Mole and Frog merchant objects have proper icons and breakable. Also, both have Novakid lines, and the Mole has proper descriptions

+ [M] The maximum number of possible dungeons per vanilla surface biome changed to 7 (was 1 in SG)

+ [F] Reduced lag at the Outpost:
 - Patched animation and script delta values of NPCs and objects to higher delay values

+ [N] Outpost Water Cooler can be used as 9-slot storage container

+ [N] Water and Healing water will spawn in Water Cooler and Outpost Water cooler in previously unvisited worlds

+ [M] Removed protection from randomly generated dungeons. Explaination: they weren't designed to use shields in the first place, and lots of players has already experienced problems with being unable to even access their front entrances, "thanks" to randomly generated ground obstacles, which also went under protection of the shield

+ [M] In order to compensate the protection removal, Tesla Spikes now have 20 points of "health" and much harder to harvest as a result

+ [M] Changed monster_surprise sound effect for randomly generated monsters to:
 - Small Biped - angstyhead_small_turnhostile.wav

 - Apex - Windows 8
 - Avian - Zork
 - Floran - DOS variation
 - Glitch - parodies Linux
 - Human - Windows NT 5.x
 - Hylotl - Commodore 64
 - Novakid - PFUDOR

 - 4096 x 2160

+ [F] Performance patch: added optimized Hobo true-type font (58 KiB and ~50000 points versus 86 Kib and ~90000 points) with fixed cyrillic characters (officially part of the game since Spirited Giraffe builds)

+ [M] Replaced Chucklefish icon and logo animation with recoloured & shaded version (also fixed "u" which strongly resembled "v")

+ [M] All tutorial quests replaced with new descriptive ones which better match the mod's progression and cover the most of its important changes. Old tutorial questline is no longer used nor called

+ [R] Removed "nude" and re-added "invisible" status effect for tent objects (as a side-effect, they no longer show bugged lit sprite which sometimes was floating in the air when player got up. Same as in EK)

+ [N] Limit for items per cell changed to 99999 (won't show up properly the number of items after 9999, though)

+ [N] Block radius for placing changed to 4 (was 2 in EK/xG)

Nightly changes

To-do list
----------

Seamlessly integrate the old quests and boss fights back into game:

+ Restore Jelly (DONE!)

+ Restore Fatal Circuit (DONE! Needs animation definition fixes)

Bring back biome variety:

+ Restore all removed biomes and mini-biomes

+ Restore removed microdungeons

+ The moons with more life and loot underneath, not just a stinky fuel

+ Barren worlds with realistic core, undercaves and stuff

Bunch of other stuff I tend to forget...


Stuff I can't fix (yet)
-----------------------

+ Lack of hunger and temperature system (hardcoded)


Contributors (they are awesome, all of them)
--------------------------------------------

These people has (in)directly contributed a huge amount of fixes and/or significant improvements. In alphabetical order:

* Grover Cures Houses (repairable tools flag)
* Kawa (JSON stuff, modding tips and tricks)
* LoPhatKao (Lua coding and major fixes for bosses, restored monster sound effects! ^o^)
* Rhyssia (initial Fatal Circuit fixes, which kick-started more stuff)
* Sayter (major fixes for Jelly Boss)
* XNicoX14 (alternative repairs mechanism and inspiration ^u^)
* xxswatelitexx (JSON stuff, modding tips and tricks)


Third-party mods merged with CLeF
---------------------------------

Note: THIS IS NOT A MODPACK, as the merged mods are not simply copy-pasted, but rebalanced, rearranged and tightly integrated with the rest of the content, hence they WILL CONFLICT WITH ORIGINAL MODS.
