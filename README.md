# Choke Le Fish
Starbound content restoration and gameplay tweaking mod

Version 1 (2015/02/10)
---------
For Upbeat Giraffe 2-666

Overview
--------

As you probably know, not all players are happy with the changes that were made to the game in comparison with Enraged Koala builds. Although many new things were added, a lot of the aspects were nerfed or removed altogether, which made the game less fun and far more boring.

This mod is my small and cumbersome attempt to address and revert these changes in Upbeat Giraffe to some degree, as well as introduce other balance tweaks, which are backported from the Enraged Koala I modded privately for my personal enjoyment. ;)


Glossary:
--------

* EK - Enraged Koala
* UG - Upbeat Giraffe

Changes:
-------

+ Molten Core can be crafted from 10 core fragments (the recipe added to stone furnace upon pickup, originally was dropped by UFO boss in EK)

+ Metalwork station now requires 1 Molten Core to craft (same as in EK)

+ Core fragment now gives 10 points of fuel (seriously, what that pile of blasted glowing stones is even good for?!)

+ Oil now gives 1 point of fuel (it's flammable IRL, so why not?)

+ Coal now gives 2 points of fuel (same as in EK, 0 in UG)

+ Intraspace travel now takes 5 points of fuel (was 50 in EK, 0 in UG made little to no sense, but...)

+ Interspace travel now takes 300 points maximum (was 200 in EK and up to 1000 in UG, which is unreal and would leave you with depleted engine. This seems to be the reason (beside the coal not being a "fuel" anymore) why intraspace travel was made cost free in UG, otherwise you'd stuck forever if landed on anything but the Moon or Outpost planet)

+ Limit for items per cell changed to 9999 (was 1000 in EK/UG. Everybody wants to be super greedy sometimes :3 )

+ All pickaxes and drills now have EK's durability values (not the mining area, though) and won't break so fast:
 - All drills      (1000 -> 3000)
 - Copper Pickaxe   (200 -> 7500)
 - Silver Pickaxe   (200 -> 7500)
 - Golden Pickaxe   (200 -> 7500)
 - Diamond Pickaxe  (350 -> 7500)
 - Platinum Pickaxe (200 -> 10000)

+ Iron Beacon is available for crafting. As a result, the Penguin UFO boss can be summoned (moved to its own quest location in UG)

+ [Incomplete] Decoy Princess is available for crafting. As a result, the bone dragon boss can be summoned (disabled in UG, no proper quest yet. Sadly, dragon acts like a bird and won't breathe any fire nor open its mouth)

+ [Incomplete] Brain extractor and all robot parts are available for crafting. As a result, you can summon the robot boss (disabled in UG, no proper quest yet. In UG original robot was replaced by Penguin Bot and appears instead of the old one when summoned)


To-do:
-----

! The moons with more life and loot underneath, not just a stinky fuel

! Barren worlds with realistic core, undercaves and stuff

! Make Penguin UFO boss to drop 5 Molten Core (removed in UG)

! Seamlessly integrate the old quests and boss fights back into game, including the distress beacon UFO with the secondaries and the old robot boss (add as an alternative way of obtaining Core Fragments and/or Molten Core and the processor chip)


Stuff I can't fix (yet):
-----------------------

* Lack of hunger and cold/hot temperatures on the lowest game setting (hardcoded)

* Repairable pickaxes and drills (hardcoded, but may possibly be overridden if you'll hook them with LUA code which re-adds "broken" counterparts and accepts the ore)


P.S. The patch system doesn't seem to work properly in my case, so using the entire file replacements instead (compatible with patches). Will surely break compatibility with UG other than 2-666, so any help would be very much appreciated.
