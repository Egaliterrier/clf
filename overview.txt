[RIGHT][I]"...people play your game as they want, [B]not as you wished them to[/B]."

[COLOR=#ffffff][B]OVERVIEW[/B][/COLOR]
[B][COLOR=#ffffff]_________[/COLOR][/B]

As you probably know, not all players are happy with the changes that were made to the game in comparison with Enraged Koala builds. Although many new things were added, [URL='http://community.playstarbound.com/index.php?threads/hark-a-stable-update-v-upbeat-giraffe.89411/page-49#post-2438012'][COLOR=#ffffff]a lot of the aspects were nerfed or removed altogether, which made the game less fun and far more boring[/COLOR][/URL] (click on the white text to see my thoughts about these changes).

[B]CLeF[/B] is my [S]small and clumsy[/S] attempt to address and revert these changes in Upbeat Giraffe to some degree, as well as introduce other balance tweaks and enhancements, which are ported from the Enraged Koala I modded privately for my personal enjoyment. ;)

Starting from Version 6, [B]CLeF[/B] also incorporates work by other awesome people. [B]See the full list of mods and their authors at the end of the description.[/B]


[COLOR=#ccff99][B]INSTALLATION[/B]
[B]___________[/B][/COLOR]

[COLOR=#ffffff][B]Warning! If you have previous version installed, please delete any directories or .modpak files which match "cl*f*" pattern.[/B][/COLOR]

Copy the following directories into "starbound/giraffe_storage/mods/" directory:
[LIST]
[*][COLOR=#99ffff][B]CLeF - Common[/B][/COLOR][COLOR=#ffffff], contains the core mod files common for all game versions[/COLOR]
[*][COLOR=#ccff99][B]CLeF - UG 2-668 Stable[/B][/COLOR], if you have [COLOR=#ccff99][B]Stable[/B][/COLOR] release between UG [B]2-666[/B] and [B]2-668[/B]
[*][COLOR=#ffcc99][B]CLeF - SG 1-677 Stable[/B][/COLOR], if you have [B][COLOR=#ffcc99]Stable[/COLOR][/B] release SG [B]1-677[/B] from April 21 and up
[*][COLOR=#cc99ff][B]CLeF - Cheats[/B][/COLOR], if you hate the restrictions which were imposed on us by Chucklefish (and want to loot everything in the scripted worlds) ;)
[/LIST]

[COLOR=#ff9999][B]F[/B]REQUENTLY[B] A[/B]SKED[B] Q[/B]UESTIONS
[B]____________________________[/B][/COLOR]

[B]Q: [COLOR=#ffffff]So, I've repaired my ship and decided to move to another planet in the local system. I'm clicking "GO" and nothing happens.[/COLOR]
A:[/B] You'll have to fuel your ship first (lava, coal, core fragment ore or even oil will do the trick). Please keep in mind the intraspace travel is no longer free. The fuel cost simply doesn't show up on Tier 2 ships (without repaired FTL drive) due to a bug.

[B]Q: [COLOR=#ffffff]I can't access fuel hatch! My character has stuck at his starter planet! I was playing as custom race.[/COLOR]
A:[/B] It's impossible for me to fix custom races due to random mod load order and the fact .png definition files cannot be incrementally patched. Please ask the author of that race to move working fuel hatch from Tier 3 ship to Tier 2 (I've asked some of them, and you can find their races in "Recommended mods" section).

Also, you can fix it on your own - open <racename>t2blocks.png and copy fuel hatch pixel (orange-red at the top of a blue block) from <racename>t3blocks.png. Note you'll have to delete your shipworld, otherwise the fix won't be applied (don't forget to take everything you don't want to lose with you).

[B]Q: [COLOR=#ffffff]Okay, I beat the UFO boss. Where's the rest of the quests?[/COLOR]
A:[/B] Since the version 22 you can beat the Bone Dragon boss. It's integrated into Outpost Mute Glitch's quest line.

[B]Q: [COLOR=#ffffff]Will I be able to play on vanilla servers if I'll install this mod?[/COLOR]
A:[/B] Short answer: no. Long answer: any mod which makes changes to .config files or adds new objects will not be compatible with vanilla servers.


[COLOR=#cc99ff][B]HELP WANTED[/B]
[B]____________[/B][/COLOR]

As a beginner in Starbound modding, I have little to no knowledge in Lua, so this prevents me from re-implementing lots of things. I would really appreciate your help.[COLOR=#ffffff][B] If you've noticed another feature, object or armor that was removed by Chucklefish and want it back, [COLOR=#ffff99]please tell me immediately[/COLOR]![/B][/COLOR]

[I][B][COLOR=#ff99cc][Fix][/COLOR] Fixed inability to fuel your ship for vanilla races when starting a new game[/B][/I] (required because intraspace travels are not free anymore)
[I][B][COLOR=#99ffff][Mod][/COLOR] Interspace travel now takes 300 points maximum[/B][/I] (was 200 in EK and up to 1000 in UG, which is unreal and would leave you with depleted engine. This seems to be the reason (beside the coal not being a "fuel" anymore) why intraspace travel was made cost free in UG, otherwise you'd stuck forever if landed on anything but the Moon or Outpost planet)

[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/IRkfsWx.png[/IMG]
[I][B][COLOR=#99ffff][Mod][/COLOR] Limit for items per cell changed to 9999[/B][/I] (was 1000 in EK/UG. Everybody wants to be super greedy sometimes :3 )

[B][COLOR=#ffcc99]THIRD-PARTY MODS MERGED WITH CLeF
________________________________[/COLOR][/B]

CLeF is not a classic "modpack", as the merged mods are not simply copy-pasted, but rebalanced, rearranged and tightly integrated with the rest of the content, hence they will conflict with original mods.[B] Use these only if you're not planning to install CLeF.[/B]
